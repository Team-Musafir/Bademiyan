The Goddess has been worshiped in India since Vedic times. Scriptures say everything emanates from her. She is the source of Shakti. The beginning and the end….The Whole creation lives in her. Shakti is a concept or personification of the divine feminine creative power, sometimes referred to as “the Great Divine Mother” in Hinduism.\n\nThis Goddess Shakti, the Goddess of power, is said to be the complete incarnation of the Adi Shakti. Shakti is the presiding deity of the Shaktas, one of the three streams of Hinduism.\n\nSome of the great religious texts like the Shiva Purana, the Devi Bhagavata, the Kalika Purana and the Astashakti recognize Bimala (Paada Khanda or feet) inside the Jagannath Temple in Puri and Tara Tarini (Stana Khanda or breasts) at Purnagiri near Berhampur in Odisha.\n\nThe Biraja Temple or Girija Kshetra, Oddiyana Peetha is believed to be another Shakti Peetha in Odisha. An Oddiyana is an ornament worn by women around her navel. According to Tantra Chudamani, Sati’s navel fell in Utkala (old name of Odisha) and is known as Biraja Kshetra. Sri Adi Shankara in his Astadasha Shakti Peetha stuti describes the Goddess as Girija.",
